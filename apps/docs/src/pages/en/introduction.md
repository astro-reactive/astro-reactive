Thanks for checking out the Astro Reactive Library! Welcome to a new adventure.

This project aims to be a new library of components and utilities for building reactive user interfaces with [Astro](https://astro.build).

We are working on a fun and easy tutorial so you can learn how to build reactive UIs with Astro from scratch using our packages. For now, see our [API Docs](/en/api) for example usage.

## Contributing

Any contribution is welcome. Feel free to look around our [repository](https://github.com/ayoayco/astro-reactive-library) to find something that interests you. :)

There's a lot of opportunity to contribute. A good start will be to understand what Astro is, and how to set up a basic Astro project. For this, the [Astro website](https://astro.build) and [documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) are good places to start.

The [issues page](https://github.com/ayoayco/astro-reactive-library/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22accepting+PRs%22) contains some ideas, but they should not limit your contribution.

If you don't find anything there, I'm happy to help you get your contribution in.

You can always [create a new issue](https://github.com/ayoayco/astro-reactive-library/issues/new/choose) for your own idea, [email me (ayo@ayco.io)](mailto:ayo@ayco.io) or message me on [Twitter (@ayoayco)](https://twitter.com/ayoayco).
