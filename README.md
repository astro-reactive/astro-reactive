[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) has begun! 🚀

Any contribution is welcome. See our [contributing guide](https://github.com/ayoayco/astro-reactive-library/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and feel free to look around to find something that interests you. :)

Maybe add some themes to our form component? Or maybe an improvement for the README?

The [issues page](https://github.com/ayoayco/astro-reactive-library/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22accepting+PRs%22) contains some ideas, but they should not limit your contribution.

If you don't find anything there, I'm happy to help you get your contribution in.

You can always [create a new issue](https://github.com/ayoayco/astro-reactive-library/issues/new/choose) for your own idea, [email me (ayo@ayco.io)](mailto:ayo@ayco.io) or message me on [Twitter (@ayoayco)](https://twitter.com/ayoayco).
